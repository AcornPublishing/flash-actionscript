It is a wrapper for the stringprimitive data type, therefore allowing you to use the <span class=Code><spanstyle='font-family:Courier'>String </span></span>object’s properties andmethods directly on primitive string data types.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>&nbsp;</p><p class=MsoBodyText>In Flash MX, the <span class=Code><span style='font-family:Courier'>String </span></span>object has been converted to a native object.That means the <span class=Code><span style='font-family:Courier'>String </span></span>object has been converted to C++ code and compiled with the Flash Player whereas in previous versions it was interpreted ActionScript. This means you’ll seea huge increase in performance from the <span class=Code><spanstyle='font-family:Courier'>String </span></span>object. Incidentally, the <spanclass=Code><span style='font-family:Courier'>XML </span></span>and <spanclass=Code><span style='font-family:Courier'>Array </span></span>objects werealso converted to native objects. See also <span class=ImportantWord><spanstyle='font-family:Helvetica'>String (function) </span></span>and <spanclass=ImportantWord><span style='font-family:Helvetica'>“” (String delimiter). </span></span></p><h3>Description</h3><p class=MsoBodyText>This object is used to manipulate and manage strings.</p><h3>Examples and practical uses</h3><p class=MsoBodyText>See <span class=ImportantWord><span style='font-family:Helvetica'>String.indexOf, </span></span><span class=ImportantWord><spanstyle='font-family:Helvetica'>string.slice </span></span>and <spanclass=ImportantWord><span style='font-family:Helvetica'>String.concat. </span></span></p><h3>Tips and precautions</h3><p class=MsoBodyText>The difference between string literals and string objectsare as follows: string objects are created by the new constructor and have adata type of <span class=Code><span style='font-family:Courier'>Object </span></span>object. String objects contain methods and properties that are used internally(by other methods of the <span class=Code><span style='font-family:Courier'>String </span></span>object) and by developers. String literals are not objects and have a data typeof string, rather than <span class=Code><span style='font-family:Courier'>Object </span></span>object.</p>
