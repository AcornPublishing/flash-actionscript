For a standarddesktop, or laptop screen, it is 72dpi. For other screens, the DPI setting mayvary.</span></p><h3><span lang=EN-US> Examples and practicaluses</span></h3><p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US> For atraditional cathode ray tube (CRT) screen, the DPI setting is a very rough (andsomewhat outdated) measure of how big an image will appear on the screen. As arule of thumb, if you scan an image at 72DPI, it will appear on a monitor at asize that is consistent with the original hardcopy.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US> &nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US> On oldermachines, the available resolutions were not as wide as they are today, andthey approximated 72 (or 75) DPI. In particular, an 800x600 size screen on atypical 15-inch monitor will show consistent image sizes if you scan at 72DPI.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US> &nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US> Whenusing Flash, the DPI is an indication of the density of pixels on the screen. Ascreen with a high DPI will display a smaller image for the same resolution,and this may affect the readability of your page.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US> &nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US> Newermonitors can handle a wide range of resolutions because both their pitch (the densityof phosphor dots across the face of the screen) and maximum scan frequencies (ameasure of the screen refresh rate) have improved dramatically.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US> &nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US> Forexample, a 21-inch monitor can display any screen from about 400x300 up to1600x1200, and each one has a different corresponding DPI setting. A 21-inchscreen displaying a 1600x1200 screen has a corresponding DPI of approximately100. If you use the same monitor to display a 600x400 screen, the DPI scan ratefor an image is less than 40.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US> &nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US> In allthese cases, Flash will return the &quot;default value&quot; of 72DPI. It canbe seen that with today's technology, the default DPI setting is a verybroad-brush figure! This all means that all you can assume from the defaultvalue of 72 is &quot;this is a standard monitor&quot;.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US> &nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US> Fordevices that <i>do not</i> return the default value, you can start to infersome meaning; it gives you a measure of how big pixels on the screen willappear compared to the &quot;classic&quot; 800x600 screen/15-inch CRT computerscreen. A DPI setting larger than 72 will mean that the pixels will be denserand therefore smaller and text may have to be bigger to make up for this.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US> &nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US> See </span><span lang=EN-US> theexample </span><span class=Code><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Courier;'><a href="../fla/system.capabilities.fla">system.capabilities.fla</a></span></span>and <span class=Code><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Courier;'><a href="../swf/system.capabilities.swf">system.capabilities.swf</a></span></span>.<span lang=EN-US></span></p><h3><span lang=EN-US> Tips and precautions</span></h3><p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US> As seenin the discussion above, this property is only useful for non-standard devices.You cannot use it to detect different sized &quot;standard monitors&quot; forexample. This is a shame, because as most designers know, a browser lookssomewhat different on a 1600x1200 screen than it does on a 640x480 one! Thereis another set of properties that <i>will </i>allow you to do something in thissituation however, and they are the properties: </span><spanclass=ImportantWord><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Helvetica;'>System.capabilities.screenResolutionX</span></span><span lang=EN-US>  and </span><span class=ImportantWord><spanlang=EN-US style='font-family:Helvetica;'>System.capabilities.screenResolutionY</span></span><span lang=EN-US>. In general, it is a good idea tolook at the </span><span class=ImportantWord><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Helvetica;'>screenDPI</span></span><span lang=EN-US>, </span><span class=ImportantWord><spanlang=EN-US style='font-family:Helvetica;'>screenResolutionX</span></span><span lang=EN-US>, and </span><spanclass=ImportantWord><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Helvetica;'>screenResolutionY</span></span><span lang=EN-US>  properties together when forming a view on how a site will look on aparticular screen.</span></p>
