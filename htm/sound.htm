With this object you can add sound, load soundsfrom files on a server, and among others alter the volume of the sound. Youshould use this method to retain ultimate control over your sound, rather thanapplying a sound to a frame, which gives you limited options at runtime fordynamically controlling the sound.

Since stereo sounds contain twice as much data they are thereforetwice the size, in bytes. Be aware of your target audience and if stereo soundis really necessary.</p>
