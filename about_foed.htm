We also love that great ideas         evolve. Networks have changed everything. They make fantastic innovation         accessible to millions.<br>        <br>        Designing with code is a radical change too. It's not scary, in fact it         can be really fun. We'll show you how. <br>        friends of ED are designers who love change. We love how the best ideas         evolve bottom-up. Top-down establishment culture is all talk. Creative         networks are where the future really swings.<br>        <br>        friends of ED try and cultivate the cross-points between those networks         so that the web can come true: returning the power of design and radical         innovation to the people who do it best: You.<br>        <br>        You're the designer. Believe in what you see. Create great work. We'll         help the ripples grow.<br>        <br>        For information on other friends of ED titles please visit <a href="http://www.friendsofed.com" target="_blank">friendsofed.com</a>.         </font></p>      <hr size="1" noshade>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We at friends         of ED want you to get the most out of the books that we produce. For us,         the commitment to the customer doesn't just stop when you walk out of         the door having bought our book, but when you finish the last page and         have understood every last word to your satisfaction. Because of this,         we offer much more wide-ranging support than any other publisher.<br>        <br>        If you don't understand the concepts within the book or are having problems         with a particular page or section, then email <a href="mailto:support@friendsofed.com">support@friendsofed.com</a>,         with the last four digits of the isbn in the subject of the mail (that's         0586 for Flash MX Designers ActionScript Reference) in the subject field         of the e-mail. Your message is delivered to our crack team of support         professionals who are the first people to read it. We have files on the         most frequently asked questions and will answer anything generally immediately.         We answer general questions about the book and CD.<br>        <br>        Deeper queries are forwarded to the technical editor responsible for that         book. They have experience with Flash MX and ActionScript and are able         to answer detailed technical questions on the subject.</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>        <br>        Finally, in the unlikely event that the editor can't answer your problem,         they will forward the request to the author. We try to protect the author         from any distractions from writing. However, we are quite happy to forward         specific book related requests to them. All friends of ED authors help         with the support on their books. They will either directly mail the customer         with the answer, or will send their response to the editor who will pass         it on to the reader.<br>        <br>        If your enquiry concerns an issue that is outside of normal book support,         then these type of questions are answered at the <a href="http://friendsofed.infopop.net/2/OpenTopic" target="_blank">friends         of ED forums</a>.<br>        <br>        </font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>    </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
