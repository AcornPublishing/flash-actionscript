His spare time was partly taken       up by freelance web design, something that slowly took up more and more       of his time until the engineering had to go. He is now also writing for       friends of ED, something that is taking more and more time away from web       design, funny how life repeats itself!

At that       age, I began playing the piano, which was sitting unused in our house. I&#146;ve       been playing ever since then. Later, in 1997, I co-wrote a full-length musical       called Chrystanthia. Somewhere along the way, I picked up game programming       as a hobby, and eventually ended up making games professionally for home       console systems. Then, in 1998, I discovered how I could take all my experiences       and combine them when I discovered Flash. The rest is history.
